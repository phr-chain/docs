## Major Updates:

### Improvement: Moving ACLs from ethereum to IPFS

### Issue: Encrypting/Decrypting custom messages:

#### Problem 
No way to encrypt or decrypt data using the user's key, only an [EIP](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/130) with almost no progress.

#### Workaround
We will ask the use to provie his own private key for now. (it will never leave the DApp)
